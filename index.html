            <h1>Quick Facts about Mountains</h1>
                <p>
                    Mountains make up about one-fifth of the world's landscape, and provide homes to at least one-tenth of the world's people.

                    <br> Heights of mountains are generally given as heights above sea level.

                    <br> The world's highest peak on land is Mount Everest in the Himalayas. It is 8,850.1728 m (29,036 ft) tall.

                    <br> Ben Nevis is also the highest mountain in Great Britain.

                    <br> The tallest known mountain in the solar system is Olympus Mons, located on Mars.

                    <br> There are mountains under the surface of the sea!

                    <br> Mountains occur more often in oceans than on land; some islands are the peaks of mountains coming out of the water.

                    <br> About 80 per cent of our planet's fresh water originates in the mountains.

                    <br> All mountain ecosystems have one major characteristic in common - rapid changes in altitude, climate, soil, and vegetation over very short distances.

                    <br> Plants that may be found on mountains include conifers, oak, chestnut, maple, junipers, stonecrops, campions, mosses, ferns and climbers.

                    <br> The highest 14 mountains in the world are all found in the Himalayas

                    <br> In some mountainous areas the rivers are permanently frozen.
                    These are called glaciers.
